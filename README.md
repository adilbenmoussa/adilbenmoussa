## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Software Architect, Engineer & Consultant** who helps teams modernize and scale their platforms.  
I love turning large, messy codebases into clean, elegant systems and guiding teams through tough transitions.  

Specialties:  
- **Enterprise Angular migrations** (yes, I’ve fought the AngularJS → Angular 20 dragons 🐉)  
- **Frontend integrations** (connecting things that don’t want to connect 🤝)  
- **Mobile engineering** with React Native & native iOS (Objective-C/Swift)

## 🏗️ Key Focus Areas

- 🧭 **Architect / Consultant**  
  Designing scalable frontend architectures, advising teams, and coaching best practices.  

- 🅰️ **Angular Migration Specialist**  
  Upgrading legacy apps → Angular 20 with **signals**, standalone components, zoneless mode, and strict typing.  

- 📱 **Mobile Engineer**  
  Cross-platform apps in **React Native**, plus performance-tuned native iOS (Objective-C/Swift).
