## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Software Architect & Engineer** who enjoys turning large, messy codebases into scalable, elegant systems.  
Specialties: **enterprise Angular migrations** (yes, I’ve fought the AngularJS → Angular 20 dragons 🐉),  
**frontend integrations** (connecting things that don’t want to connect 🤝),  
and **mobile apps** with React Native & native iOS (Objective-C/Swift).

## 🏗️ Key Focus Areas

- 🧭 **Architect / Software Engineer**  
  Designing scalable frontend architectures, micro-frontends, and integration platforms.  

- 🅰️ **Angular Migration Specialist**  
  Upgrading legacy apps → Angular 20 with **signals**, standalone components, zoneless mode, and strict typing.  

- 📱 **Mobile Engineer**  
  Cross-platform apps in **React Native**, plus performance-tuned native iOS (Objective-C/Swift).
